# PortfolioProjectBTS
This is a project analyzing data from the U.S. Dept. of Transportation on daily travel during the pandemic.

In this project I am aiming to create data tables using SQL so I can then create a dashboard in Tableau. I have a basic knowledge of both SQL and Tableau so I am working on this project to develope both of these technical skills.

I plan on updating this as I go, the next step will be creating a dashboard to display the tables.

The Tableau dashboard has been created and linked via the website under the repository.
